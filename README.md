### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level, interpreted programming language created by **Brendan Eich** in 1995.

- Itâ€™s primarily used for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
- JavaScript is multi-paradigmâ€”it supports object-oriented (prototype-based), functional, and imperative programming.
- Although single-threaded by design, it handles asynchronous operations efficiently through the event loop, callbacks, and Promises.
- Modern engines like V8 also JIT-compile JavaScript for performance.
- Beyond the browser, itâ€™s widely used on the server-side with Node.js.

### Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language or both?

JavaScript is both compiled and interpreted. While JavaScript is fundamentally an interpreted language, JavaScript engines uses **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation in modern browsers. This means, the JavaScript code is compiled into machine code at runtime, just before it's executed. This makes JavaScript a compiled and interpreted programming language.

### What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` keywords?

In JavaScript, variables are declared using the keywords `var`, `let` and `const`. They are differ in terms of scope, initialization, whether they can be redeclared or reassigned, and the behavior when they are accessed before declaration.

| Feature       | `var`                          | `let`                           | `const`                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Scope        | Function or Global             | Block                           | Block                            |
| Initialization | optional                     | optional                        | required                         |
| Re-declaration | Allowed                      | Not allowed                     | Not allowed                      |
| Re-assignment | Allowed                       | Allowed                         | Not allowed                      |
| Access before declaration  | `undefined`      | `Reference Error`               | `Reference Error`                |

### Explain the concepts Hoisting?

**Hoisting** refers to the behaviour where JavaScript moves the declarations of variables, functions, and classes to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. This can sometimes lead to surprising results, especially when using var, let, const, or function expressions.

-   Hoisting applies to variable and function declarations.
-   Initializations are not hoisted, they are only declarations.
-   `var` is hoisted to the top of its scope (function or global) and initialized with undefined until assiging a value.
-   `let` and `const` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. accessing these varaible will throw `ReferenceError`.

### What is Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)? 

Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) refers to the period between the entering of a scope (such as a function or block) and the actual initialization of a variable declared with `let` or `const`. During this time, any reference to the variable before its initialization will throw a ReferenceError.

### Data types in JavaScript?

Data Types in JavaScript can be categorized into primitive and non-primitive based on how they are stored, handled in memory, and how they behave during assignments and comparisons.

1) **Primitive Data Type** - values are immutable and are stored by value.

   - **Number**: Represents numeric values (integers and decimals).
   - **BigInt**: Represents integers larger than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.
   - **String**: Represents text enclosed in single or double quotes.     
   - **Boolean**: Represents a logical value (`true` or `false`).
   - **Undefined**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.    
   - **Null**: Represents an intentional absence of any value.    
   - **Symbol**: Represents unique and immutable values, often used as object keys.
   
3) **Non-Primitive Data Type** -  values are mutable and stored by their reference in the memory

   - **Object**: Represents key-value pairs. 
   - **Array**: An ordered collection of elements.
   - **Function**: Represents reusable blocks of code.
   - **Map**: An ordered collection of key-value pairs.
   - **Set**: An unordered collection of unique values.
