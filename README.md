### What is Typescript?

Typescript is an oper-source, statically typed programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It act as a superset of JavaScript by adding optional type-checking and the features of object-oriented programming such as class, interface, modules etc.. into JavaScript.

- **Static type-check**: Allows developers to explicitly define types for variables, function parameters and return values, enabling type-checking during the development (compile-time) rather than solely at runtime, helping to catch errors earlier.
- **Compilation to JavaScript**: TypeScript code is not directly executed by browsers or Node.js. Instead, it needs to be compiled (or "transpiled") into plain JavaScript using the TypeScript Compiler (tsc). This generated JavaScript can then run on any platform that supports JavaScript.
